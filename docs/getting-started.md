# Getting Started

1.  Camouflage is an NPM package, therefore to install Camouflage, you'd need to install NodeJS (>v14) first, if you haven't already done so.
2.  Install Camouflage: `npm install -g camouflage-server`
3.  Run `camouflage --version` to validate the installation was successful.
4.  Create an empty directory anywhere in your machine and navigate to it in your terminal.
5.  Execute command `camouflage init`. This creates a basic skeleton of the folders you'd need in order to get started. You can modify these folders as per your requirements.
6.  Start the Camouflage server by initializing it with a config.yml file: `camouflage --config config.yml`

## Configuration Options / Sample Config yml File

## Create your first mock

Camouflage follows the same convention as mockserver to create mocks. For example,

1. You start by creating a directory `${MOCKS_DIR}/hello-world`
2. Create a file GET.mock under `${MOCKS_DIR}/hello-world`
3. Paste following content:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Custom-Header: Custom-Value
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "greeting": "Hey! It works!"
}
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/hello-world](http://localhost:8080/hello-world){target=\_blank}

### Building from source

If you'd like to get the latest version of Camouflage, you can build it from the source.

!!! note

    Building from source might have it's own drawbacks, most important of all is that source is always in beta. There might be some bugs which are still being worked upon. You might want to proceed with that aspect in mind.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fauxauldrich/camouflage.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm build`
4. At this point you can run Camouflage using: `node bin/camouflage.js --config ./config.yml`
5. However if you'd like to install Camouflage globally, execute: `npm pack`
6. Install by running command: `npm install -g camouflage-server-${version}.tgz` or `npm install -g camouflage-server-${version}.zip`
