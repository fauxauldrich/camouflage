# Camouflage UI

Camouflage also provides a file explorer UI allowing you to work with your mocks. Camouflage uses a standalone UI that can be downloaded as an npm package from [camouflage-filemanager](http://npmjs.com/package/camouflage-filemanager){target=\_blank}. It currently allows following actions:

- Create mock files/folders' structure
- View and edit mock files
- Delete mock files/folders
- Download files
- Cut or Copy files/folders

New features will soon be added to the UI, such as:

- Uploading files
- Uploading folders as zip/tgz
- Renaming files/folders
- Integrated terminal
